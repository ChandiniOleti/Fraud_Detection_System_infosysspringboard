# Fraud_Detection_System_infosysspringboard
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets. The goal is to build a reliable and efficient model that minimizes false positives and accurately identifies fraudulent activities.


## Overview
This project aims to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle, which contains anonymized features and transaction information.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to build a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions to mitigate risks and improve financial security.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle - [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**: The dataset includes 284,807 transactions with 31 features (28 anonymized features, time, amount, and class).
- **Class Distribution**:
  - 0: Non-fraudulent transactions (majority class)
  - 1: Fraudulent transactions (minority class)

## Dataset Overview
- **Total Data**: 8,83,097
- **Total Rows in Dataset**: 28487
- **Columns**: 31
- **Class Distribution in Raw Data**:
  - Non-Fraudulent Transactions: 284315
  - Fraudulent Transactions: 495

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
  
## Steps Followed

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Checked for null values and data consistency.
- Scaled numerical features using `RobustScaler`.
- Balanced the class distribution using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
- Visualized transaction amount trends and time-based patterns.
- Applied standardization to numerical features.
- Addressed the class imbalance using oversampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE).
  
- **Correlation Heatmap**:
  - Analyzed correlations between features and the target variable.
  - Identified features most related to fraudulent transactions.

### 3. Model Development
- Implemented various machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - CatBoost
  - SVM
    
- Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Used cross-validation to assess model performance.
- Compared metrics to identify the best-performing model.
- **Best Performing Model**: CatBoost with an accuracy of 99.95%



üöÄ ##Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset with detailed visualizations.
Preprocessing: Handles imbalanced datasets using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE).
Feature Engineering: Selects key features to optimize model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for fraud detection.
